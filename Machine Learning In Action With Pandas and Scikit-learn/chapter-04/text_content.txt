SITEN te sege and te assaut watz sesed at Troye,
Te bor? brittened and brent to bronde? and askez,
Te tulk tat te trammes of tresoun ter wro?t
Watz tried for his tricherie, te trewest on erthe:
Hit watz Ennias te athel, and his highe kynde,
Tat siten depreced prouinces, and patrounes bicome
Welne?e of al te wele in te west iles.
Fro riche Romulus to Rome ricchis hym swyte,
With gret bobbaunce tat bur?e he biges vpon fyrst,
And neuenes hit his aune nome, as hit now hat;
